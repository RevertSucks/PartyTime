## message
beginning of project started a day or two ago. currently waiting to get [luraph](https://lura.ph/) untill i continue  
as this is a wip expect changed, more games, patches, ect.  
i also should mention i would prefer to keep this **free** without any key system.  
the "offical" release will be on my [scriptblox](https://scriptblox.com/u/Exxen)  
and since im not leaving project code open souce (well build a boat is rn so is universal) i would like 2 request no attempts at revealing how these scripts work.
